Fair tent mini game.
Player has to press the targets that appear, and this throws a ball towards the target.
The player has 3 lifes, the player loses one when he is to slow.
If the player has lost all his lifes, his endscore is shown.
The targets appear slow at first but start to speed up.
The desire to beat his highscore, keeps the player engaged.
